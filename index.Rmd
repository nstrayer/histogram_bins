```

### Data

The data being used for the following histogram is generated with this code: 

```{r}
data <- purrr::map_df(1:20, ~data_frame(x = rnorm(n = 20, mean = ., sd = 0.1)))
```

It's a bunch of normals spaced along a line from 0-20 in an effort to simulate digit preference in a measurement such as blood pressure. 

### Histogram

Drag the slider below to change the histogram bin numbers. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
r2d3(data = data, script = "interactive_histogram.js", dependencies = 'd3-jetpack', container = 'div')
```
